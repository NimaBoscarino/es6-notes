    - hoisting and scope
    - block level scope
- fancy string interpolation with backticks
- Arrow functions
    - nice for inline functions
    - get rid of "THIS"
    - have different context than a function literal (e.g. loss of argument object)
    - Do a demo with "this", showing advantages + disadvantages

- New versions and additions to JS
    - transpilers
        - e.g. SASS for CSS
